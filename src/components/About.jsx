              I'm a software engineer based in Sydney with a background in site
              management and civil engineering design. Ever since I was a child,
              I've had a deep passion for programming and technology. I've
              always loved to explore and experiment with new technologies, and
              I find the process of creating innovative solutions to complex
              problems truly exhilarating.
